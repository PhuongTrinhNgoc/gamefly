            I am located in Russia and my Support-A-Creator affiliate account
            has been disabled - What happens now?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Epic has stopped commerce with Russia in our games as a response to
            the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This includes the Support-A-Creator
            affiliate program.
          </p>
          <p>
            For creators in Russia, Support-A-Creator program affiliate
            membership is now disabled across Epic products. Your creator code
            remains reserved so that no one else can claim it. You can continue
            to host games via custom matchmaking in Fortnite. And you can still
            create and publish islands using Fortnite Creative.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you had not reached the path to payout eligibility, your account
            balance was reset. Accounts with payments pending will be paid once
            Epic’s payment service provider is able to complete payment in
            accordance with applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, new Support-A-Creator applications from creators based
            in Russia are not currently being approved. However, in the near
            future we will provide an alternative application option for
            creators in Russia to re-enter the program with commerce disabled.
            Please continue to check the Support-A-Creator FAQ page for updates.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have questions or if you are no longer residing in Russia,
            please reach out to Epic Player Support using “INQUIRY ON RU SAC
            DISABLE” in the description.

          <h4>WHAT IS THE EPIC GAMES SUPPORT-A-CREATOR PROGRAM?</h4>
          <p>
            Support-A-Creator enables Creators to earn money by creating content
            for Fortnite, Rocket League, and many games in the Epic Games Store.
            Epic believes that Creators are an essential part of building
            communities around awesome games. We recognize how important
            Creators of all kinds have been to our success, so we built this
            program to share in that success.
          </p>
          We’re looking for Creators that focus on the quality of the moments
          they make and share, the communities they build, and the love they
          have for the games they play.

            CREATIVE ISLANDS AS AN EPIC GAMES SUPPORT-A-CREATOR AFFILIATE?
          </h4>
          You’ll be able to create custom matches and publish your Fortnite
          Creative Islands once you have provided your complete and accurate tax
          and payment information through Epic’s approved tax and payment
          processing partners (and received confirmation that verification was
          successful). Please note that verification can take anywhere from a
          few days to a few weeks.

        <div className="main-all-text-FQA">
          <h4>WHERE CAN I CHANGE MY CREATOR CODE?</h4>
          <p>
            You’ll select your Creator Code during the signup process for the
            Support-a-Creator program.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can change your Creator Code without contacting Player Support,
            through the Support-a-Creator tools in the Epic Account Management
            page.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can navigate to the Epic Account Management page directly, via
            epicgames.com, by clicking the Profile in the top right corner,
            selecting Account, and then select the Support-a-Creator tab. From
            there, you’ll find instructions to enter your desired new Creator
            Code and check that it’s available. If it meets all the requirements
            listed, and is available, you can lock it in right there.
          </p>

          <p>
            After your Creator Code has been selected, you will only be able to
            change it once during any 12-month period.

          <h4>HOW DO CREATORS EARN MONEY?</h4>
          <p>
            For Fortnite, accepted Creators will earn 5% of the value of in-game
            purchases made using their Creator Code. This applies to earned
            V-Bucks, purchased V-Bucks and most real-money offers. Players
            declare their support for a Fortnite Creator in-game by entering the
            Creator’s code via the “Support-A-Creator” button.

          <h4>WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE?</h4>
          <p>
            For Fortnite, accepted Creators will earn 5% of the value of in-game
            purchases made using their Creator Code. This applies to earned
            V-Bucks, purchased V-Bucks and most real-money offers. Players
            declare their support for a Fortnite Creator in-game by entering the
            Creator’s code via the “Support-A-Creator” button.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Epic Games Store games, Creators can share referral links on
            their channels or promote their Creator Code to their supporters, to
            get credit for sales of those games. Each game has a different
            revenue share for attributed sales set by the game's developer, but
            all games have a minimum rate of 5%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the game, players can choose to support a different
            Creator at any time. Once selected, that Creator Code will be set
            for 14 days, unless another Creator Code is entered. After 14
            consecutive days, the previously-selected Creator Code will expire,
            at which point players can select the same Creator Code another
            14-day period, or choose a new one.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Rocket League, accepted Creators will earn 5% of Credits spent
            in-game while using their Creator Code. This applies to Credits used
            in the Item Shop, Blueprint building and Rocket Pass Premium
            upgrades. Players declare their support for a Rocket League Creator
            in-game by entering the Creator's code in the Item Shop.

              Are at least 13 years old, or at least 14 years old if you are a

            The Support-A-Creator program is not open to individuals or entities
            who do not meet the eligibility requirements listed above. Creators
            who previously violated the Affiliate Agreement for
            Support-A-Creator, which includes violations of the
            Support-A-Creator Code of Conduct, and were removed from the program
            are not eligible to reapply or be reinstated. Additionally, the
            program is not open to individuals or entities in China or wherever
            restricted or prohibited by applicable law or in any country
            disallowed by U.S. law. This includes, but is not limited to,
            individuals or entities in Cuba, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq,
            Lebanon, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria,
            Zimbabwe, and the regions of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk.

          <p>
            The Epic ecosystem and the Support-A-Creator program celebrate
            diversity and hope to continue adding support for additional regions
            and languages over time.

          <h4>WILL THIS PROGRAM MAKE CREATORS RICH?</h4>
          <p>
            Please expect modest results. The amount you earn scales with the
            number of players who choose to support you. A Fortnite example: If
            your in-game supporters spend 50,000 V-Bucks in-game, then you would
            earn $25 USD. An Epic Games Store example: if your supporters
            purchase $100 of games, you’ll earn $5 (at the base Epic-funded
            rate).
