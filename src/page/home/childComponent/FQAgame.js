              The Forbidden West will be an immersive open world, filled with
              adventure, culture, and opportunity. But it will also be vast and
              deadly, filled with ancient ruins, awe-inspiring machines, and
              hidden threats.

              The Living World team at Guerrilla worked on aspects of the game
              that make the world feel authentic and alive: the tribes, the
              settlements, and the people within them.

              Yes. Building upon the foundation of {data.name} Zero Dawn, Aloy
              will have a number of new ways to move through the world like high
              vault traversal mechanics, the ability to free climb, and swimming
              underwater which opens up new aspects of exploration.

              Weapons and outfits are also even more potent than before, and new
